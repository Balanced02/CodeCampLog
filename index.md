##### Starting a new project on React-Native
+ go to the folder you wanna do the project in your terminal
- react-native init weCodeApp2
- npm install
- open your android studio and get the emulator on
- react-native run android // it'll load the embedded server and download some apps, you'll need internet for your first running
- by default, it has an android folder// you can write your codes in the java file under /android/app/src/main/java/com/wecodeapp2
- by default, it runs in debug mode // so you'll need to build a signed key and embed it in your java
- it's better to write your app in another folder application/component directory //you'll need to create it
- you can also create another folder assets under application where you can store your images, css files and others...
- command d//reloads ios emulator
- RR //reliads android emulator
- NB: you can enable live reload & hot reload on the emulator; an advantage of react-native over native stuffs
